    <div class="about-description">
      <p>I've completed Le Wagon coding bootcamp (Paris, Batch #200 - dec 2018) to add technical skills to my creative profile (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, RubyOnRails)ðŸš€<br>
      Passionate about the tech/startup environment, I have always been interested in creating and managing my own projects.<br>
      Indeed, I created and developed Miranda App, a language learning plattaform (2018/2019).<br>
      After this amazing entrepreneurial experience, I keep working as a freelance creating several projects.<br>
      At the same time working as TA at Lewagon BS AS helping new tech students during the bootcamp. <br>
      Currently working as "CEO" at GV-WEB, the building web page of your life ðŸš€ </p>
